events are basically time slot of the day
there would be the following static events:
breakfast(optional) , morning-classes, lunch, afternoon-classes, class-end activity


Event struct : 
    Place(Enum) place : #i.e basketball court, football, canteen
    Heroine(struct) girl : #enum with the girls as choices
    Event(struct) next : 


Dialogue struct:
    char text[200];
    Dialogue(struct) choices[3];


heroine_list = #array containing the structs for the heroine
a newly entered Event, randomizes the Place as well as the pointer to its heroine
heroines are randomized by randomizing a number between 0-2 (inclusive) and getting the pointer inside the herone_list using the index that is randomized(0-2)
